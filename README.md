A cursor implemented in JavaScript [Demo](https://virtual-cursor.netlify.com/)

- Powerful plugin system
- Comes with plugins that imitate native behaviour:
  - **DragSelection** - Drag to select text
  - **ClickSelection** - Select words by double clicking them
  - **WindowBoundary** - Prevents the cursor from moving outside the page
  - **NativeEvents** - Interoperability with native JS mouse events

# Why

- Apply custom easing to the movements
- Sync mouse movements across browsers
- Loads more


# Usage

see `test/index.ts` and `src/CursorCapture/plugins/*` for examples on how to create plugins
