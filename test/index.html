  <p>A <b>double-click</b> is the act of pressing a <a href="/wiki/Computer_mouse" title="Computer mouse">computer
      mouse</a> button twice quickly without moving the mouse. Double-clicking allows two different actions to be
    associated with the same mouse button. It was developed by <a href="/wiki/Bill_Atkinson" title="Bill Atkinson">Bill
      Atkinson</a> of <a href="/wiki/Apple_Computer" class="mw-redirect" title="Apple Computer">Apple Computer</a> (now
    Apple Inc.) for their <a href="/wiki/Apple_Lisa" title="Apple Lisa">Lisa</a> project.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a
        href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> Often, <a href="/wiki/Point_and_click#Single_click" title="Point and click">single-clicking</a>
    selects (or highlights) an object, while a double-click executes the function associated with that object.
    Following a link in a <a href="/wiki/Web_browser" title="Web browser">web browser</a> is accomplished with only a
    single click, requiring the use of a second mouse button, "click and hold" delay, or modifier key to gain access to
    actions other than following the link. On <a href="/wiki/Touchscreen" title="Touchscreen">touchscreens</a>, the
    double-click is called "double-tap"; it's not used as much as double-click, but typically it functions as a zoom
    feature. ("triple-tap" sometimes used to zoom the whole screen.)
